# Web Scraping Project : Scraping Hotel List from Booking.Com
* I scraped the list of the hotels available for Mumbai city(India) from the website - booking.com.

* This website is being used all around the world.

* If you want to check-out this website.

* The link is here- https://www.booking.com/

# The Objective of this project would be 

1. Scrape hotel list available at Mumbai location.

2. We'll scrape hotel name, reviews, locality, ratings and more.

3. Finally we'll make a csv file for further analysis and use.

# Tools I am Going to Used -

1. VS Code
2. Python
3. Python Libraries such as bs4, pandas, lxml, requests, and jovian.

# Imports

``1. Beautiful Soup``

BS4 module helps in pulling data out of HTML and XML files. For scraping we need to import BeautifulSoup function from the bs4 module.

``2. Requests``

Requests is an elegant and simple HTTP library to request and retrive the data from the server.

For more info: https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/

``3. lxml``

lxml is the most feature-rich and easy-to-use library for processing and parsing XML and HTML. Although there is an inbuilt parser avaibale, I prefer to use it because of its speed.

``4. Pandas``

Pandas is one of the most powerful and easy to use data structures and data analysis tool. We'll use it for organising, viewing and saving our scraped data.

``5. Matplotlib``

Matplotlib is an easy to use data analysis and data visualisation tool. We'll use it for making graphs and plots out of our scraped data.

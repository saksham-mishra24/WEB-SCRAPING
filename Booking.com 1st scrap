# Step 1 - Introduction

## Our Database

All of our data lives within a PostgreSQL database and contains a single schema called `trading`.

In PostgreSQL, a database can contain multiple schemas, and a schema is a collection of tables and other database objects.

## Copy and Run a SQL Query

To run our first query together - you can click on the right hand corner of the following code snippet below to copy a basic `SELECT` query to your clipboard.

You can then paste it into your SQLPad interface and click on the `Run` button in the top right corner or hit `cmd` + `enter` on Mac or `control` + `enter` on Windows to run the query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM trading.members;
```

This `SELECT` query above will return all of the records from the `members` table inside the `trading` schema.
